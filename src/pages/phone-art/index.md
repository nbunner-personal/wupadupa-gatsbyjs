<p>so we did the <a href="mail_art.html">mail art</a> thang and it was jolly yes it was so! we wanted to do something similiar but this time everything was recorded using mobile phones.</p>

<p>quick explanation - the last image from the <a href="mail_art.html">mail art</a> film was sent to a musician's phone, via multimedia message, who then recorded a piece using their mobile phone. This piece was then sent on to an artist's phone who would respond (within half a day) with either a still image or video, again recorded with the mobile phone.</p>

<p>The artiste didn't know when they were to receive the music/image this created a potentially massive time limitation - especially if they were busy! But I loved this idea, firstly because I'm rarely busy - so I was OK :) but also because of the fact the phone is portable you can record sound/image anywhere.</p>

<p>This means you have to be in a creative/aesthetically aware state wherever you are and however mundane your surroundings. I'd like to be in that state the whole time, but I tend to forget!

<p>There will hopefully be another one sometime in the future.</p>
