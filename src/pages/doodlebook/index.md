Welcome to the strange and wonderful world of the Wupadupa doodlebook.

At every Wupadupa gig the doodlebook is passed around for members of the audience to sign, leave comments in and draw the odd doodle in. The comments and doodles capture the essence of each gig and range from the deeply personal to the rather weird! We regularly post the best ones on here on the site where you can both view and leave comments about them.
